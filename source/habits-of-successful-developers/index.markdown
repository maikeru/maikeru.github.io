One of the things that makes a good developer is their habits. 
This page will be a collection of habits that I hope will help me become a better developer.

Toolkit Sharpening
------------------
From the excellent [play-by-play](https://peepcode.com/products/play-by-play-benorenstein) with Ben Orenstein. 
He keeps a list of things that bother him with his tools then spends some time each day improving his environment based on that list. 

Examples:

* aliases to commonly used shell commands
* vim leader settings
