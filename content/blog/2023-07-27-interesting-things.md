Got a bunch of things I'd like to look into more:

## Garmin health tracking

Currently I use my Garmin watch with the Garmin Connect app and that's fine but I'd like to see what I can do with my own data and see how practical it is to use this kind of device in a privacy friendly way. I.e. not sending my data to a third party which could, for example, become inaccessible.

A Typescript library for processing Garmin and other similar device's data file: [sports-lib](https://github.com/sports-alliance/sports-lib)

## Home Assistant

Not that I have any home automation right now, it could be interesting to e.g. measure heat, humidity and air quality in different parts of the apartment and coordinate that somehow. Not sure if there would be anything to automate though. Privace conscious, Open Source version of this seems to be [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)

## Solid Pods

Don't know much about this yet. Seems to be an actual way to have users host their personal data somewhere and provide access to parts of it to 3rd parties. Rather than having lots of 3rd parties each having your private data and promising not to do anything bad with it. I like the idea (seems similar to how things are set up in The Expanse book series among others) but haven't read up on how well implemented it is, concerns or support (can you actually use it for anything yet?). Definitely something to read up more on.
