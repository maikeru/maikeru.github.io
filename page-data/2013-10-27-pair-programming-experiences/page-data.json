Last month we did the Mastermind game used as an example in The RSpec Book and this\nmonth we did <a href=\"http://nabetani.sakura.ne.jp/hena/ord7selectchair/\">ゆっくり座りたい〜</a> which is a problem about seating order.\nBoth problems are presented in a format ideal for Test Driven Development (TDD) with expected outputs for different inputs that\nexercise all the edge cases of each problem. This makes it easy to proceed one step at a time, first writing code that produces\nthe correct output for the simplest case and then gradually moving on from there.</p>\n<p>Pair programming is unsurprisingly a very sociable experience. Two people work together with one person “driving”\n(writing code) and the other “navigating” (watching for mistakes, giving feedback and direction and asking questions).\nYou take turns in each role swapping whenever you feel like it. The atmosphere is very different to the MokuMoku Kai meetings\nthat we usually do (MokuMoku literally means to do something quietly) with everyone talking at the same time.\nI remember a few occasions when someone tried to address the whole group and we just kept on going anyway (sorry Aki-san!).</p>\n<p>In each of the Pair Programming in Action sessions we made sure to pair with someone different from before.\nIt was interesting to see how much of a difference having a different pair makes. Everyone has a different approach to things\nand a different communication style. From my first pair I learnt a lot about the core ruby libraries and some git commands.\nFrom my second pair I learnt about some useful tools (tig) and environment settings.</p>\n<p>One pain point was switching roles. We each used our own laptops rather than working together on one (which would have been\ntoo cramped and awkward). This meant that when we wanted to switch roles the driver would push their changes to Github and the new\ndriver would pull those updates. This is fine if the switch occurs when all tests are passing but sometimes its nice to switch\nin the middle of a problem when one person has an idea that is easiest expressed in code. As a result I’ve started looking into\nremote pair programming.</p>\n<p>I went into both of the pair programming sessions without any preparation. I’d heard about pair programming before and even done\nsome casual pair programming at work but I hadn’t thought about or researched how to make the most of the experience.\nBased on the little research it looks like I might have missed some things - such as the particular roles of the driver\nand navigator and what each is responsible for. I’m looking forward to having another go but in the mean time I think I’ll do\nsome reading on the topic:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Pair-Program\">How to Pair Program</a></li>\n<li>Remote Pair Programming Resources at <a href=\"http://www.pairprogramwith.me/\">PairProgramWith.me</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Pair Programming Experiences","date":"October 27, 2013","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2013-08-27-ascii-sort/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ascii Sort"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2013-11-21-first-day-of-ruby-world-2013/2013-11-21-first-day-of-ruby-world-2013/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"First Day of Ruby World 2013"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"de908075-1d1c-58b8-8b8a-e4a08ff4ac75","previousPostId":"fa98a54e-b1e7-5403-a8c7-c7250176021c","nextPostId":"4ffcfac3-1d79-54ca-8f7b-68a9e6c2f9e4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1394841729","2841359383"]}
